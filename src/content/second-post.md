## Svelte

Media inside the **static** folder is served from `/`.

> The title shift from **Fullstack** â†’ **Product Engineer** has some prior art. Design has seen a similar shift. Titles like **UI/UX Designer** and **Graphic Designer** are increasingly being replaced by **Product Designer**.

### Classification

Adversarial attacks on classifiers such as `langchain` and `faiss` have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $x$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $x_{\text{adv}}$ with imperceptible difference from $x$, such that $f(x) \neq f(x_{\text{adv}})$.

$$
x_i \sim P_{\theta_i} = \text{Categorical}(\pi_i) = \text{Categorical}(\text{Softmax}(\theta_i))
$$
